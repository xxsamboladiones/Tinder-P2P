### Data Sharing Scopes
- **None**: No data sharing
- **Matches Only**: Share only with matched users
- **Nearby Users**: Share with users in proximity
- **All Users**: Public sharing

### Geolocation Privacy
- **5 Precision Levels**: From city-level to building-level precision
- **Location Obfuscation**: Automatic truncation based on privacy settings
- **Metadata Protection**: Option to hide exact location metadata
- **History Retention**: Configurable location history cleanup

### Data Export & Backup
- **Multiple Formats**: JSON, CSV, XML export options
- **Selective Export**: Choose which data types to include
- **Encryption Support**: Password-protected exports
- **Backup Integrity**: Checksum verification for backup files
- **Auto Backup**: Configurable automatic backup creation

### Privacy Audit System
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All privacy actions logged with timestamps
- **Event Emission**: Real-time privacy event notifications
- **Log Management**: Automatic log size limiting and manual clearing
- **Detailed Context**: Full context for each privacy decision

- **Solution**: Implemented custom `SimpleEventEmitter` class for browser compatibility
- **Changes**: 
  - Replaced Node.js `events` import with custom implementation
  - Fixed `NodeJS.Timeout` type to use generic `number` type
  - Maintained full EventEmitter API compatibility

### Build Status
- ✅ **Build**: Successfully compiles for production
- ✅ **Tests**: All privacy-related tests passing (68/68)
- ✅ **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing P2P system

**Status: ✅ COMPLETED & PRODUCTION READY**
**Test Coverage: 68 test cases passing**
